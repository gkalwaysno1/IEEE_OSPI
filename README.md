# Multilabel Disease Prediction Model
This project aims to develop a multilabel disease prediction model using a set of features from multiple datasets. 
The primary requirements for this project include exploratory data analysis, implementation of neural networks in either PyTorch or TensorFlow, 
and an understanding of medical diseases and how to correctly understand the features of the dataset. 
The models used in this project include U-net, CNN, and Faster R-CNN.

# Dataset
We have used the 
1. [Brain Tumour Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset) 
2. [Skin disease dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/surajghuwalewala/ham1000-segmentation-and-classification) for this project.

The **Brain-tumor dataset** contains MRI images of the brain, while the **Skin disease dataset** contains Cases include a representative collection of all important diagnostic categories in the realm of pigmented lesions:

Actinic keratoses and intraepithelial carcinoma / Bowen's disease (AKIEC),
basal cell carcinoma (BCC),
benign keratosis-like lesions (solar lentigines / seborrheic keratoses and lichen-planus like keratoses, BKL),
dermatofibroma (DF),
melanoma (MEL),
melanocytic nevi (NV)
vascular lesions (angiomas, angiokeratomas, pyogenic granulomas and hemorrhage, VASC).


# Neural Networks Implementation
Regarding the implementation of neural networks, we have used PyTorch for this project. PyTorch is gaining popularity for its simplicity, ease of use, dynamic computational graph, and efficient memory usage. PyTorch optimizes performance by taking advantage of native support for asynchronous execution from Python.
