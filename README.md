# Multilabel Disease Prediction Model
This project aims to develop a multilabel disease prediction model using a set of features from multiple datasets. 
The primary requirements for this project include exploratory data analysis, implementation of neural networks in either PyTorch or TensorFlow, 
and an understanding of medical diseases and how to correctly understand the features of the dataset. 
The models used in this project include U-net, CNN, and Faster R-CNN.

# Dataset
We have used the [Brain Tumour Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection/code) and Skin disease dataset for this project. 
The Brain-tumor dataset contains MRI images of the brain, while 
the Skin disease dataset contains clinical and dermoscopy color images of skin diseases.
